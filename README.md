> **Disclaimer:** This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or related to [OpenClaw.ai](https://openclaw.ai)**, the OpenClaw Foundation, or the Church of Molt. We just really like coleslaw. And lobsters. Coincidentally.

## What is this?

OpenSlaw is a production-grade, enterprise-ready coleslaw recipe — optimized for lobster pairing — disguised as an AI startup. Or maybe it's an AI startup disguised as a coleslaw recipe. Our legal team (one very confused lobster) is still working on it.

**Live site:** [openslaw.ai](https://openslaw.ai)

## Features

- **SlawFormer™ v3 Model** — Our proprietary cabbage-shredding transformer architecture
- **12,847 Shreds/min** — Industry-leading throughput on NVIDIA H100 mandolines
- **Mayo-Free Guarantee** — Vinegar-based dressing, cryptographically verified
- **Recipe Scaling** — Quantum-resistant serving size adjustment (1x–4x)
- **Dark Mode** — For when you're shredding after hours
- **17 Arcade Games** — The Slaw Labs Arcade, because every AI startup needs a game division
- **Lobster Pairing Protocol** — Patent-pending crustacean-coleslaw alignment
- **Enterprise Pricing** — From Free Tier ("fork it yourself") to Enterprise ("we julienne for you")
- **Konami Code Easter Egg** — ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA on the main page. You're welcome.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install openslaw --no-mayo

# Or via npx
npx create-openslaw-app my-slaw --template=vinegar-based

# Or just clone it like a normal person
git clone https://github.com/peterhanily/openslaw.git
cd openslaw
open index.html
```

## API Usage

## Benchmarks

| Cabbage Type | Shreds/min | Crunch Factor | Lobster Pairing Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Green (standard) | 12,847 | 0.94 | 0.99 |
| Napa | 14,203 | 0.87 | 0.91 |
| Red | 11,456 | 0.96 | 0.97 |
| Savoy | 9,832 | 0.91 | 0.88 |
| Brussels Sprout (micro) | 47,000 | 0.72 | 0.43 |

*Benchmarks conducted on a single NVIDIA H100 mandoline with 80GB of vinegar-cooled VRAM. Results may vary based on ambient humidity and proximity to lobsters.*
