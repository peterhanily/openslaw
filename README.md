# OpenSlaw.ai

A parody site about open-source coleslaw. The `.ai` stands for "actually incredible" (coleslaw).

This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or related to [OpenClaw.ai](https://openclaw.ai)** in any way. We just really like coleslaw.

## What is this?

A single-page static site hosted on GitHub Pages at [openslaw.ai](https://openslaw.ai). It features a genuinely great coleslaw recipe optimized for lobster pairing, dressed up in AI startup language.
